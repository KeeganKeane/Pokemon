# Pokemon SQL 

What it is: 
  A C# program that pulls Pokemon data from a pokemon API and successfully pushes them into an organized SQL Server 

Why: 
  Done in collaboration with another developer in which they developed the frontend that allows users to input a pokemon. The program will then return what Pokemon types would be good against that pokemon as well as what pokemon types the user inputted pokemon would be good against. This was created with the purpose to give myself experience with C# as well as SQL. 
  
Tools Used: 
- C#
- SQL
- React.js
